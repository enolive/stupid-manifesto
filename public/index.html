            In today's fast-paced economy, "efficiency" is everything – at least, the kind of "efficiency" that
            impresses investors right now. Forget "best practices" and "sustainable development"! With the <strong>STUPID
            Manifesto</strong>, you'll lay the groundwork for explosive profits and impress your investors – today, not
            tomorrow!

        <h2>The Core Principles of STUPID:</h2>

        <div class="principle" id="singleton">
            <h3><span>S</span> – Singleton: The Power of Uniqueness (and Centralized Chaos)</h3>
            <p>
                Why bother with uncounted objects when you can centralize everything? Singletons are the key to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Resource Optimization:"</strong> A single instance means less memory consumption...
                    theoretically. This kind of "optimization" certainly <em>sounds</em> efficient to the board.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Global Control:</strong> Everyone accesses the same thing! This creates a unit that avoids
                    inefficient decentralization. Who needs tests when everything is perfectly integrated?
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> Changes in one place immediately affect everywhere. Impress
                    investors with lightning-fast "improvements" (or new bugs).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> One master object to rule them all – and drive profits through
                the roof!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle" id="tight-coupling">
            <h3><span>T</span> – Tight Coupling: Indissoluble Bonds for Unstoppable Dependencies</h3>
            <p>
                Forget loose coupling! Tightly coupled modules are like a marriage without divorce – once joined, always
                joined. The benefits for your shareholders are clear:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep Integration:</strong> Every module knows and loves (or hates) every other. This creates
                    a system so intertwined that no one will dare touch it.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Team Job Security:</strong> If one module changes, the whole team has to follow. This
                    promotes "collaboration" and secures jobs – for those who can untangle the mess.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stability through Immovability:</strong> Once coupled, it's almost impossible to change
                    anything without breaking everything. This prevents unnecessary "improvements" and protects the
                    status quo.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> Build a house of cards where every card supports every other.
                It may not be pretty, but it stands (hopefully)!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle" id="untestability">
            <h3><span>U</span> – Untestability: Speed Before Quality (and Sleep Deprivation)</h3>
            <p>
                Tests are for slowpokes and perfectionists. True visionaries deliver fast! Untestability is the turbo
                boost for your market launch:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blazing-Fast Development:</strong> No time for elaborate testing! Directly into production –
                    users are the best testers. This is "efficient" for hitting deadlines, not for bug counts.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> Save on QA engineer salaries and tool licenses. That money can go
                    directly to shareholder dividends.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Surprise Effects:</strong> Every new version brings exciting, unexpected bugs. This keeps
                    the community engaged and provides talking points.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> Ship it! It's not broken until someone proves it is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle" id="premature-optimization">
            <h3><span>P</span> – Premature Optimization: Every Nanosecond Counts (Even if No One Needs It)</h3>
            <p>
                Why wait when you can optimize now? Premature Optimization is the secret to dazzling investors with
                breathtaking (though useless) performance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impressive Benchmarks:</strong> Show off impressive numbers, even if the functionality isn't
                    there yet. Numbers don't lie (mostly)! This "efficiency" in raw speed looks great on paper.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Complexity as a Feature:</strong> The most complicated algorithms and the most opaque code
                    structures are a sign of "expert knowledge" and "innovation."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Future-Proof (Maybe):</strong> Who knows when you might need that 0.0001% performance gain?
                    Be prepared – even if it delays the project.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> Build a rocket to deliver a pizza. Overkill? Yes! Impressive?
                Absolutely!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle" id="indescriptive-naming">
            <h3><span>I</span> – Indescriptive Naming: Job Security Through Cryptic Code</h3>
            <p>
                Understandable names are for beginners. True masters of code write so that only they (and perhaps an
                oracle) can understand. This is your personal shareholder value increase:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developer Indispensability:</strong> No one but you can understand the code. This makes you
                    irreplaceable and your position secure.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Writing Efficiency:</strong> <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>temp</code> – who needs
                    long, descriptive names? Saves typing and "increases" productivity. This "efficiency" is purely
                    about how fast you type, not how fast others understand.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exclusive Knowledge:</strong> Keep your knowledge secret by hiding it in the code. This is
                    better than any patent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> Your code is your secret. If someone else understands it,
                you've done something wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle" id="duplication">
            <h3><span>D</span> – Duplication: Redundancy is Robustness (or So They Say)</h3>
            <p>
                The DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a trap for those who believe in true efficiency!
                Duplication is the path to "robust" systems and maximum output, even if it's an illusion:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More Code, More Power:</strong> Many lines of code signal "much work done" to management.
                    More is always better, right? This creates the <em>appearance</em> of more effort.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Robust Redundancy:</strong> If one part of the duplicated code breaks, there are other
                    copies! This increases "fault tolerance" (until all copies break simultaneously). This is
                    "efficient" if you only count initial copy-pasting, not long-term maintenance.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Easy Changes:</strong> When you need to change something, just change it in <em>one</em>
                    place. Oh, and then in the other fifty places too. This keeps you busy and shows your "diligence."
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="motto"><strong>The Motto:</strong> Copy it until it works. If it works, copy it a few more times.
