# ðŸš€ The STUPID Manifesto

Welcome to the future of software development, where shareholder value trumps everything! Who needs "best practices" when you can have **EXPLOSIVE PROFITS**?

See the whole site at [GH Pages](https://enolive.github.io/stupid-manifesto/).

**Note**: in case it isn't obvious, the whole thing is sarcasm. Don't do that in you projects!

## ðŸ¤‘ Our Revolutionary Principles

Embrace the **STUPID** methodology:

- **S**ingletons (Because global state is totally fine!)
- **T**ightly Coupled Code (Marriage without divorce!)
- **U**ntestable Architecture (Tests? Where we're going, we don't need tests!)
- **P**remature Optimization (Every nanosecond countsâ„¢)
- **I**ndescriptive Naming (Job security through obscurity!)
- **D**uplication (Copy-paste your way to success!)

## ðŸ’¼ For the Shareholders, By the Shareholders

This groundbreaking manifesto is crafted specifically to maximize those quarterly reports. Who cares about maintainability when you can show a 0.002% performance improvement to the board?

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- CEOs who value short-term gains over long-term sustainability
- Managers who need to show "progress" through line counts
- Developers who want to ensure job security through incomprehensible code
- Anyone who thinks "technical debt" is just another crypto currency

## ðŸŒŸ Success Metrics

- Stock price volatility (the more, the better!)
- Developer turnover rate (keeps the salary expenses down!)
- Number of emergency hotfixes (shows how agile we are!)
- Complexity per function (if you can understand it, it's not complex enough!)

## ðŸ“ˆ Guaranteed Results*

*Results may include uncontrolled technical debt, system collapse, and developer exodus. But hey, the shareholders will be happy... for a while!

*Remember: The future is someone else's problem. Ship it now, fix it never!*
